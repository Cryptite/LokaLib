# LokaLib
Collection of useful methods used by Loka Minecraft.

LokaLib is built on top of [Paper 1.18.2](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) and as such requires building a 
local copy to access nms.

This lib has utility methods for basic Minecraft as well as for some popular MC Plugins:

- WorldGuard
- WorldEdit 

These methods have been collected over nearly a decade and represent a very large variety of both well 
and poorly written code. Modifications, suggestions, cleanup, and documentation are encouraged and welcome.
